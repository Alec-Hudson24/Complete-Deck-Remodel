# Custom Trex Deck Remodel with Integrated Pergola
**Complete tear-out and rebuild of an entire backyard deck: larger footprint, stronger structure, low-maintenance Trex composite boards, and built-in pergola for shade and outdoor living**  
*(Family project: Demolition, framing, woodworking, composite installation – my first major hands-on build with my dad)*

## Goal / Overview
- **Primary Features**:
  - Full demolition of the old, worn-out deck and complete replacement with a bigger, more usable layout (expanded size for better entertaining and flow).
  - High-performance **Trex** composite decking: fade-resistant, splinter-free, low-maintenance, eco-friendly (made from recycled materials), with excellent traction even when wet.
  - Integrated pergola structure for partial shade, aesthetic appeal, and support for future additions like lights or vines.
  - Reinforced framing and footings for superior strength and longevity (heavier loads, no sagging, built to last).
- **Motivation**: Replace a deteriorating old deck with a durable, beautiful outdoor space that requires minimal upkeep—perfect for family gatherings, grilling, and relaxing—while learning real-world construction skills.
- **Outcome**: A rock-solid, expanded deck with seamless Trex surface and sturdy pergola. Overcame key challenges in demolition, precise framing for the larger size, and integrating the pergola posts/beams into the new structure for stability and clean lines.

## Programs and Skills Demonstrated
- **Demolition & Site Prep**: Safe tear-out of old decking/framing, disposal, ground leveling, and new concrete footings/piers for load-bearing support.
- **Framing & Structural**: Precise layout and construction of larger joist/beam system (e.g., upgraded lumber sizes, closer spacing, proper ledger attachment to house), ensuring code-level strength for bigger span and added pergola weight.
- **Material Installation**: Cutting, fastening, and finishing Trex composite boards (hidden fasteners for clean look), plus pergola build (posts, beams, rafters)
- **Problem-Solving**: Coordinating expanded layout, aligning pergola posts with deck framing/footings (avoiding overload on deck-only supports), maintaining level during build, and managing weather/timing as a family team.
- **Other**: Hands-on learning from my dad, tool use (circular saw, drill, level, post-hole digger, etc.), material sourcing/ordering, safety practices, and end-to-end project management.

## Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned
- Plan twice, measure three times—especially on a full rebuild where mistakes in framing or footings are expensive to fix.
- The foundation (footings and framing) is everything: overbuild for strength when going bigger or adding features like a pergola to handle wind, snow, and people.
- Composite like Trex saves huge time on maintenance long-term—no staining, no splinters, no rot—but requires careful installation (proper gapping, fasteners, ventilation underneath).
- Working side-by-side with family (my dad) on a big project builds skills fast, teaches patience, and creates lasting memories—even when things get tough.
- Start small if you're young/new to this: hands-on experience with demo, measuring, and heavy lifting preps you for bigger things later.

## Future Improvements / Ideas (don't live there anymore so improvements are just ideas that would have been cool)
- Incorporate built-in benches, planters, or an outdoor kitchen area.
- Upgrade to Trex railing or add privacy screens.
